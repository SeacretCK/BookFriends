My first really complex Vue App, using Vue Router, Vuex, Vue-Draggable, Vue-Select, Vue-Toastify, Moment as well as Firebase Authentication and Firebase Firestore. The styling is done with Sass.

The site uses the GoogleBooks API. You can search for books with a simple or an advanced search. You can create booklists and add books to them. You can comment, delete and sort the books in your lists. Each user has a dashboard and a profile, where they can add some information about themselves. As Firebase offers the possibility to listen for realtime updates in the database, there's also the feature of a live chat. Your dashboard lists your conversations with other users and notifies you about new messages in realtime.
